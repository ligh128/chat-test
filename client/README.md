This folder contains the front-end code for the web application. It is built using React and Material-UI library.

## Getting Started

To run the client locally, you should have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git> .
2. Navigate to the client folder: cd your-repo-name/client
3. Install the dependencies: npm install
4. Start the client: npm start

This will start the development server and open a browser window displaying the running application. Any changes to the code will automatically trigger a re-build and reload the browser.

## Folder Structure

The client code is organized into different folders according to their functionality:

- src : This is the main folder that contains all the source code for the client.
- public : This folder contains the public assets needed by the client, such as the HTML file and other static files.
